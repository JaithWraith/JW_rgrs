Wraith's Rangers (@JW_rgrs) - V0.3.0
Author: JaithWraith

OVERVIEW:
As my first mod, the scope here is pretty minimalistic. The goal is to create a US Army Rangers faction using gear from Arma, its various DLCs, as well as several popular mods, for use in my casual mil-sim group, the 1-74th Rangers. This mod includes the basic team member types for the 1-74th: Infantryman Team Leader, Infantryman, Combat Engineer, Combat Medic Specialist, and Radio Operator-Maintainer. All types are fully geared and compatible with Eden and Zeus. This mod requires the latest versions of Arma 3, APEX, CBA, ACE 3, and TFAR.

1-74th RANGERS:
I have been a member of several excellent mil-sim groups, but time conflicts with living on the US west coast, my work, and family prevented me from staying for long periods. So, after recruiting some family members and getting them excited about the RP possibilities of mil-sim, I created the 1-74th Rangers. We are currently only fire team sized and are pretty casual about ranks, but we are honing our mil-sim abilities and are interested in growing. If you are at all interested, check out our Arma 3 unit page or send me a message in the BI forums/Steam as JaithWraith.

ROADMAP:
The next phase for this mod is to integrate the SCAR-H from SMA and perhaps some better recoiless rifles like the MAAWS. I am hesitant to download all of RHSUSAF just for these few weapons so let me know if there is a good standalone I just don't know about!

CHANGES:
Feel free to make any suggestions! This is my first mod and it is all about pushing myself to learn a new skill so I appreciate all of the feedback or suggestions I can get. Thanks!
