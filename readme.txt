Wraith's Rangers (@JW_rgrs) - V0.2.1
Author: JaithWraith

For additional information, you can find this project at www.github.com/JaithWraith/JW_rgrs.

OVERVIEW:
As my first mod, the scope here is pretty minimalistic. The goal of this mod is to create a US Army Rangers faction using gear
from vanilla Arma as well as the various expansions. I am creating the mod as open source on GitHub and sharing it with others
in case anyone else can make use of it.

As of V0.2.1 the base coding is in place and working as needed for the first four units: the Team Leader, Grenadier, Autorifleman,
and Medic.

ROADMAP:
Continued development will focus on adding additional units to the faction. Once a substantial number of units are in place, I plan 
to create VSM and/or RHS versions.

CHANGES:
Feel free to request any changes or improvements by contacting me on Steam and I'll see what I can do.

IN CLOSING:
As I mentioned above, this is my first mod, so please feel free to leave feedback on Steam. If you notice something I could do
better, or if you know a few technicques I could benefit from, I am more than happy to hear about it. :) This is all about pushing
myself to learn a new skill so I appreciate all of the comments I can get. Thanks!
