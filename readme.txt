Wraith's Rangers (@JW_rgrs) - V 0.1.0
Author: JaithWraith

For additional information, you can find this project at www.github.com/JaithWraith/JW_rgrs

OVERVIEW:
As my first mod, the scope here is pretty minimalistic. The goal of this mod is to create a US Army Rangers faction using gear
from vanilla Arma as well as the various expansions. I am creating the mod as open source and sharing it with others in case
anyone else can make use of it.

ROADMAP:
Once all team elements are working with vanilla and expansion Arma gear, I will work on adding items from ACE3. After that point,
the plan is to create alternative versions for RHS Escalation and/or VSM as well.

CHANGES:
Feel free to request any changes or improvements by contacting me on Steam and I'll see what I can do.

IN CLOSING:
As I mentioned above, this is my first mod, so please feel free to leave feedback on Steam. If you notice something I could do
better, or if you know a few technicques I could benefit from, I am more than happy to hear about it. :) This is all about pushing
myself to learn a new skill so I appreciate all of the comments I can get. Thanks!
